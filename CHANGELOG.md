## [Unreleased]

## [1.10.0] - 2026-07-21

A hardening release. Multi-tenant isolation, review-gate correctness, and durability
fixes dominate; there is little new functionality. Operators running a shared monolith
or tenant shards should treat this as a priority upgrade.

### Security
- Multi-tenancy: closed shared-monolith isolation gaps across sync, skills, FSRS, drain, and teardown paths, where id-addressed queries were not scoped by `user_id` (#164)
- Multi-tenancy: finished row-scoping for quota, sessions, lineage, and community edges (#169)
- Signature bypass in the auth path, cross-tenant backfill attribution, wrong per-tenant counts, and a bootstrap lockout (#167)
- GUI cookie lane now enforces the signature requirement instead of accepting unsigned requests (#167)
- Artifacts: blob paths are tenant-scoped, and shared blobs are refcounted before unlink so one tenant could not delete another's data (#171)
- Axon: subscriptions, cursors, and webhook fan-out are isolated per tenant (#172)
- Brain: hopfield decay and prune are scoped to the calling user; also fixes retrieve dilution and a dimension panic (#170)
- Review gate: closed bypasses that leaked pending memories into assembled context, derivations, and read tails (#163, #168, #174, #175)
- Tenant loader rejects tombstoned and stuck tenants instead of serving them (#182)
- Mode-independent hardening: exec-bypass, UTF-8 panic, VACUUM DoS, and an embed hang (#165)
- Server input validation: reject malformed audit filters, sanitize registry errors, validate dispatch configs (#191)
- Peripheral crates: SSH detection, socket permissions, cred migration key handling, lease scoping, and tiered sidecar auth (#193)
- Graph: sanitize artifact FTS queries and validate link similarity (#183)
- Dependency advisories: `crossbeam-epoch` 0.9.18 -> 0.9.20 (RUSTSEC-2026-0204)

### Fixed
- Backup: repaired PITR snapshot discovery (the reader did not match the `kleos-backup-` prefix the writer actually uses) and encrypted-backup verify/restore, which never opened snapshots with the SQLCipher key (#166)
- Migrations: foreign-key rebuild migrations and tenant `notx` migrations now apply atomically, so an interrupted upgrade cannot leave a half-rebuilt table (#178, #179)
- Timestamps: corrected a `datetime('now','utc')` double-UTC conversion in column defaults, which stored values offset by the server's own UTC offset (#185)
- Vector: lance upserts are serialized and crash-atomic, and chunk vectors are purged on soft delete (#181)
- Jobs: real lease tokens, panic containment, and tenant-shard job processing; the tenant PageRank job was previously compiled out of the shipped binary (#184)
- Graph: bounded co-occurrence writes (#183)
- Context assembly: failures are observable rather than silent, and truncation counts characters instead of bytes (#180)
- Embeddings: reorder OpenAI responses by index and validate ONNX output shape (#176)
- Ingestion: retryable failed ingests, RFC 4180 CSV quoting, docx `w:t` tag boundaries, document identity, and project/entity links (#189)
- Loom: the engine is actually wired to run, and hardened against DoS and leaks (#173)
- Degenerate-case handling across projects, inbox, backup, and valence (#177)
- Tenant deletion logs record real usernames, and deprovision admin responses report honest results (#192)
- Remaining library and server-route correctness fixes (#194, #195)

### Added
- Opt-in documentation emission layer for agent-forge (#186)
- Emission refuses hollow slices: a slice must carry component prose to be emitted (#190)
- High-importance memories are gated to inbox review before entering the corpus

### Removed
- **Breaking:** enrollment invites are removed end to end: the admin-scoped `POST /identity-keys/invite` endpoint, the `enrollment_invites` table, the `kleos-cli invite` subcommand, and its client route entry. The feature was never functional -- the table was write-only, with no code path that consumed a token to complete an enrollment. If invite-based onboarding returns, it needs its own design pass (#195, #196)
- Dead code: scheduler-lease, tenant-pool, reranker-pool, lexicon, and PageRank remnants (~700 lines, 4 unsafe impls); dead-letter retention wired up in their place (#187)

### Database
- Monolith migration 100: `skill_records.duration_sample_count` with backfill
- Monolith migration 101: drop `enrollment_invites` (accompanies the endpoint removal above)
- Tenant migration 83: `duration_sample_count` on tenant shards
- Upgrades are one-way. Snapshot before applying, as the removal migrations cannot be reversed.

### Changed
- `serde_with` 3.18.0 -> 3.21.0 (#188)
- npm dependency group updates in `gui/` (#160)

## [1.9.0] - 2026-07-04

### Added
- Optional default-on `ml` Cargo feature gating the local ONNX/LanceDB inference stack, so lean builds can drop the heavy inference dependencies with `--no-default-features` (#153)
- `kleos-server` systemd unit for service installs (#157)
- Admin route to mint API keys for another user

### Changed
- Context assembly: scale-appropriate default relevance floor per gate arm (cosine vs reranked), so reranked deployments stop silently dropping wanted context blocks (B2) (#151)
- CI: PR wall clock cut from ~25min to ~10min (nextest 2-way partition, parallel lint job, prebuilt cargo-deny) (#149)
- cargo-deny: ignore unfixable transitive quick-xml DoS advisories (#146)
- Internal crate dependencies pinned to workspace versions; docs aligned to actual routes and crate counts (#157)

### Fixed
- Release pipeline: repaired five silent delivery failures -- SHA256SUMS never matched (now bare filenames), installers were never published, Windows binaries were missing, the Docker image was the sidecar stage, and an ml-feature build guard (#155)
- Release build: stopped shipping unix-only crates (kleos-credd, kleos-fs) in the Windows cross-build, which had aborted it and dropped all nine Windows binaries; the ghcr image now builds the server (runtime) stage instead of the sidecar (#158)
- GUI: commit `gui/package-lock.json` so the Docker runtime image builds (npm ci needs a committed lockfile) (#159)
- Installer: upgrade safety (existing secrets preserved and backed up), honest failure reporting, and honest platform claims (#156)
- Portability: `/import` surfaces per-item write failures with 207 Multi-Status instead of reporting success on partial data loss (#154)
- Retrieval scoring refinements (B3): FSRS decay anchored on last-review time, near-duplicate detection unbounded, context recency double-count removed, PageRank scoped per user (#152)
- Reranker fusion normalization: min-max normalize the RRF-scale fusion score before the cross-encoder blend, in both the ONNX and HTTP backends, so the fusion weight is no longer negligible (#148)
- HTTP reranker (TEI): blend the sigmoid-normalized cross-encoder confidence instead of the raw unbounded logit, keeping blended scores in [0,1] (#150)
- Retrieval recall + review-gate leak + panic/tenant hardening (P0/P1 bundle) (#145)
- Session-state extraction: reject code/config-like text in location/role capture (#144)
- Dreamer: feed existing growth observations back into growth reflection (#143)
- Sidecar integration tests: wait on real observables instead of fixed sleeps; remove hidden cross-test env dependency
- Forge fsroots resolver tests made parallel-safe (#147)

## [1.8.0] - 2026-06-28

### Added
- Language-agnostic NLP: content-language detection routing across the intelligence stack (#124)
- Language-agnostic retrieval: multilingual reranker + unicode61 FTS (#119)
- i18n lexicon module (EN/FR) with French folding (#108); German (de) baseline lexicon (#114)
- Retrieval-quality v2: abstain gate, facts/episode/community channels, hop-2 expansion, fusion tuning (all default-off) (#112)
- Runtime-overridable LLM prompts with embedded defaults, security-hardened (#110)
- GET /growth/context for SIS-style prompt injection (#113)

### Fixed
- Offline reranker fallback + abstain recalibration for bge-reranker-v2-m3 (#123)
- Store/search/recall correctness fixes + retrieval-quality tuning (#105)
- Scratchpad: restore user_id tenant isolation (cross-tenant working-memory leak) (#107)
- Associative auto-linker restored as a background pass (#117)
- Sidecar watcher path parsing + Dockerfile sidecar stage (#116)
- Plaintext secret retrieval gated behind interactivity; least-privilege mirror token (#118)
- GUI: removed 3D graph flow-trail particles (#121)

### Changed
- opentelemetry migrated 0.27 -> 0.32 (#111)

## [1.7.3] - 2026-06-22

### CI

- release: build and publish `kleos-ingest` and `kleos-cleanup` as linux-x64 release artifacts so operators have a binary to pull. The `kleos-ingest` installer component previously had no matching release asset.

## [1.7.2] - 2026-06-18

### Security

- server: SSRF-harden outbound webhook and LLM delivery so callbacks cannot reach internal or link-local addresses (#103).
- auth: protect the owner account from deprovisioning so the last admin cannot be locked out (#103).
- auth: require `read` scope on read-only POST endpoints instead of leaving them unscoped (#103).
- cred: require a confidential transport for credential bearer tokens (#103).
- credd: deny the proxy by default unless an explicit domain allowlist is configured (#103).

### Build

- hooks: pre-commit now auto-formats staged Rust so CI `cargo fmt --all -- --check` cannot fail on push.

## [1.7.1] - 2026-06-16

### Added

- MCP: clients can attach artifacts inline on `memory.store` and on read tools (#98).
- MCP: underscore-normalized tool-name aliases so strict clients such as VS Code can call every tool (#97).
- forge: agent-forge absorbed into Kleos as a server-side CLI plus MCP tool surface (#96).
- cli: inject coordination read-back at session start so agents see live task/feed state.
- cli: derive the session-start bootstrap query from the cwd project and git branch.
- db: bounded `run_migrations_to` / `run_tenant_migrations_to` helpers for partial migration runs.

### Fixed

- gate: forge-authorized Write/Edit now bypass the human-approval wait instead of blocking on it (#99).
- chiasm: reap stale never-heartbeated idle tasks, not only overdue ones.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-06-13

### Added

- Frameshift cross-machine growth tenant (server-side), gated behind `KLEOS_FRAMESHIFT_GROWTH` (#94).
- kleos-phylax: secret-resolve modes. `exec` runs an allowlisted command with secrets injected into the child process, and `verify`/`sign`/`derive` let an agent use a secret without ever holding its plaintext.
- kleos-phylax: no-plaintext agent posture backed by fail-closed policy middleware.
- kleos-phylax: out-of-band approval notification and a capability-token decide endpoint.
- kleos-cleanup: `--delete-where` escape hatch for operator-specific junk.

### Security

- Security audit remediation and monolith multi-user isolation hardening (#93).
- kleos-phylax: scrub-totality property tests and an adversarial plaintext-bypass test.

### Fixed

- recall: `is_static` memories now decay by age in ranking instead of being pinned at full retrievability. The flag is caller-set and hardcoded on consolidations, and had grown to ~43% of the store, so stale "permanent" memories dominated recall regardless of age or relevance. `is_static` still protects durability (no auto-prune) and gate guard lookups.
- kleos-sidecar: drop the orphaned `GateResult.original_text` field.
- gui: untrack stale `.svelte-kit` build artifacts and restore the ignore rule.

### CI

- Pin the Rust toolchain to 1.94.0 across CI, Docker, and local dev so unpinned `stable` upgrades no longer break `clippy -D warnings`, and serialize the Syntheos mirror workflow to stop concurrent force-pushes from failing on the ref-lock CAS.

### Database

- approvals: add `decide_token_hash` column (migration 85).

## [1.6.1] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- kleos-sidecar: stop over-ingesting raw session content. `retain_tool_calls` now defaults to false, so raw tool results are no longer promoted to durable storage, and the file-watcher gate stores only its distilled summary instead of appending the full raw assistant turn.
- eidolon living prompt: removed the duplicate `EIDOLON LIVING CONTEXT` banner (the brain block now renders as a `## Brain Context` sub-section), and credential-scrubbed the injected `Relevant Memories` section.
- kleos-cleanup: open raw-keyed SQLCipher databases correctly (raw-hex `PRAGMA key`), and add a high-precision pollution purge step plus a `--purge-only` flag.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-05-14

### Fixed

- Release workflow: set OPENSSL_DIR on Windows so bundled-sqlcipher links against preinstalled OpenSSL
- Release workflow: tolerate partial matrix failure so assets upload when at least one build leg succeeds
- Release workflow: rename checksum file to SHASUMS256.txt to match installer expectations
- Installer scripts: point at Ghost-Frame/Kleos instead of Ghost-Frame/Engram
- agent-forge: add bundled rusqlite for Windows where no system sqlite3.lib exists
- PowerShell installer: add SHA-256 checksum verification (parity with Unix installer)

## [1.1.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- `kleos-client` shared crate: route registry + signed HTTP client extracted from `kleos-cli` so MCP, CLI, and any future tool share the same auth and dispatch code
- `kleos-mcp` route registry expanded from 229 to 466 canonical routes (485 tools including back-compat aliases) -- full kleos-server HTTP surface is now reachable via MCP
- `kleos-mcp` HTTP transport (`--transport http --listen <addr>`) -- one sidecar per host serves MCP over JSON-RPC to multiple local clients
- `kleos-cli activity` subcommand -- PIV-signed `/activity` reporter for agents that prefer the CLI over direct HTTP
- `render_path` helper for path template substitution with safe percent-encoding

### Changed

- `kleos-mcp` is now a thin proxy: dispatches every tool call to kleos-server via signed HTTP rather than holding its own database/LLM connections. Schema and per-tool logic live in `kleos-client::routes::ROUTES`, not per-handler code
- `kleos-server` no longer exposes `POST /mcp/dispatch`; dispatch is owned exclusively by the kleos-mcp sidecar
- Default LLM route timeout raised from 60s to 200s; global request timeout raised to 630s (env-overridable) then to 1800s to match CPU-only LLM workloads
- README rewritten to position Kleos as cognitive infrastructure rather than a memory engine
- Homepage URLs updated from engram.syntheos.dev to kleos.syntheos.dev

### Fixed

- `render_path` now percent-encodes path-segment substitutions (CWE-74 / CWE-918): an MCP client cannot pivot the URL to another route via `/`, `?`, `#`, or `%` in a string argument; non-scalar (array/object/null) path args are rejected outright. Regression coverage added in `kleos-client/src/routes.rs` tests
- `get_with_timeout` / `post_with_timeout` in `kleos-client`: `reqwest::ClientBuilder::build().unwrap_or_default()` silently disarmed the per-call timeout on builder failure; builder errors now propagate
- Drop `gui.serve_app_assets` from the route registry: the axum wildcard template `/_app/{*path}` produced the property key `*path` in the tool input schema, which fails Anthropic's MCP regex `^[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]{1,64}$` and rejected the entire 485-tool list. Tool count is 484. New `registry_property_keys_match_mcp_regex` test prevents regression

### Security

- `kleos-mcp` HTTP transport drops front-door bearer auth -- reachability (bind address) is the access-control boundary, consistent with kleos-cli. Operators must bind to a private interface (loopback, LAN, mesh)
- `kleos-mcp` hard-fails at startup if neither a PIV signer nor `KLEOS_API_KEY` is configured -- refuses to start unauthenticated

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-10

### Added

- Skills Cloud v50: aliases, bundles, materializations, hybrid find with weighted tag/text/semantic search
- Plugin importer for YAML-based skill files (`kleos-cli import-plugins`)
- User management with enrollment invites and active status tracking
- MCP schema endpoint (auth-gated) and dispatch routes with scope-gated tool categories
- Identity key rotation and metadata support
- Agent tool runtime crate (`forge`) -- skill-driven dispatch for Kleos-authenticated tools

### Changed

- All 16 workspace crates bumped to 1.0.0
- Artifact ownership model cleanup
- reqwest workspace dep gains `multipart` feature

### Fixed

- Duplicate `/users` route registration that caused a panic on startup

### Security

- MCP schema endpoint moved behind auth middleware
- Scope-gated dispatch (Admin/Write/Read per tool category)
- Fixed greedy YAML prefix matching in plugin importer
- SkillKind validation on create and update

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-08

### Added

- `/search/web` endpoint -- thin proxy over private SearXNG instance with auth, input validation, and normalized response schema
- `kleos-cli skill` subcommands (search, list, get, execute, capture, fix, derive, stats, lineage, evolve) backed by REST API
- Autonomous skill evolution in the dreamer background task -- capture, fix, and derive skills via local LLM on a 30-minute interval
- Skill evolvers (capture/fix/derive) wired to local LLM (Ollama) with three-shot prompting, sanitized output, and lineage tracking
- Activity fan-out now includes skill search on task.completed/error.raised
- Broca action ledger entries reference their Axon event ID
- `/chiasm/*` route aliases for Syntheos-convention task endpoints
- SvelteKit GUI vendored into the repo under `gui/`; graph view default raised to 5000 nodes
- Multi-arch container workflow (linux/amd64 + linux/arm64) publishing to ghcr.io/ghost-frame/kleos
- Criterion benchmark suite: embeddings, memory_search (hybrid + vector + concurrent), graph traversal, PITR, auth middleware
- `release-prod` build profile with thin LTO for faster production builds

### Changed

- `hybrid_search` returns `Arc<Vec<SearchResult>>` -- cache hits are a refcount bump instead of a deep clone (P-003)
- Search cache sharded to 32 Mutex-guarded LruCache segments instead of one global lock; capacity bumped 512 to 2048 (P-009)
- `hydrate_candidates` / `fetch_memories_batch` / `fetch_links_batch` take `Arc<[i64]>` to avoid cloning ID vecs into async moves (P-008)
- `faceted_search` takes the 4KB embedding from the request before building the inner SearchRequest (P-010)
- `embedding_to_json_array` uses preallocated buffer + `write!` loop -- 1.36x speedup (P-001)
- PageRank inner loop borrows via `.as_slice()` instead of cloning the Vec (P-002)
- Five sites in graph/search.rs and memory/search.rs use `&dyn ToSql` instead of `Box<dyn ToSql>` (P-005)
- `compute_string_facets` uses `HashMap<&str, _>` -- only unique keys allocate a String (P-007)
- `/health`, `/health/live`, `/health/ready` report `CARGO_PKG_VERSION` instead of hardcoded 0.1.0

### Fixed

- `kleos-cli store` sends importance as u8 0--10, matching server schema (was f32 0.0--1.0, causing 422)

### Security

- R8 audit: ingestion SSE relay has 5-minute timeout + heartbeat (R-006); LLM response errors surfaced instead of swallowed (R-007); context SSE logs on send failure (R-009); webhook emit logs on list error (R-011)
- R8 hardening: `validate_outbound_url` gate on sidecar's `engram_url`; non-unix `tighten_secret_perms` emits a warning; v1 API key acceptance emits counter + warning; webhook `deliver_with_retry` wrapped in panic-catching spawn with counters
- R7 audit: MCP write scope enforcement across 20+ handlers; SSRF hardening via `safe_client_builder`; bounded mpsc channels for ingestion/context progress; pepper fail-closed in release builds; YubiKey challenge-response rate limit; Content-Security-Policy baseline; PITR symlink-follow filter; GUI cookie future-timestamp rejection; CORS null origin dropped; plaintext http:// origin warning; SECURITY.md documents preauth rate limits
- Codex audit (F1--F9): sidecar partial-flush fix; trusted-proxy IP resolution shared between rate_limit and audit; migration validate returns Err on discrepancy; foreign_key_check after migration copy; /batch 207 semantics documented; CI hard-fails on missing deny.toml; Rust toolchain pinned to 1.94.0; credd shares build_router with tests; retry jitter arithmetic fixed
- Six CodeQL alerts closed: path injection in GUI secret path, four SSRF sites routed through `validate_outbound_url`; rustls-webpki bumped to 0.103.12
- Audit remediation sweep (14 tasks): PITR path traversal sandbox, atomic gate CAS, context fallback for unknown labels, ingestion session expiry propagation, libsql default-features trimmed, lru bumped 0.12 to 0.16, covering indices on memory_links, dead code removed from version-chain fetch, vector_sync batch helper, AppState embedder/reranker clone Arc out of RwLock, admin endpoint rate costs adjusted, dreamer/audit use monotonic clock, install.sh verifies SHA256 checksums

### Infrastructure

- Background task supervisor with factory-based respawn and exponential backoff, tied to shared CancellationToken for clean shutdown (R-008)
- Session reaper task evicts entries idle >1h with zero subscribers on a 60-second scan (R-010)
- Dreamer background consolidation: intelligence pipeline + dream_cycle + evolution per active user, idle-gated by audit middleware timestamp
- Gate hardening: brain-grounded check via Hopfield recall, DNS rebind/SSRF defense, agent allowlist, engram_stores enforcement
- `cognithor` module renamed to `cognitive`

## [0.3.2] - 2026-04-14
