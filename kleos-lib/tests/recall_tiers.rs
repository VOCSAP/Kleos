//! Regression tests for the recall "static" and "important" tiers (Phase 1.1 / 1.2).
//!
//! The recall endpoint must always surface pinned/static memories and high-importance
//! memories regardless of how recently they were written. The previous implementation
//! listed the newest N rows and filtered afterwards, so any pinned or important memory
//! older than that window silently disappeared. These tests seed old pinned/important
//! rows behind a wall of newer, low-importance rows and assert they still surface via
//! `memory::list_static` / `memory::list_important`.
