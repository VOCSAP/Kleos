//! Scheduled community-detection job (L4b auto-run).
//!
//! Periodically re-runs Louvain so `community_id` stays fresh as memories accumulate, which is
//! what keeps the community retrieval channel useful (a one-shot snapshot decays). Handles both
//! deployment shapes, mirroring the dreamer: monolith (`registry = None` -> iterate active
//! owners on the shared DB) and tenant-sharded (`registry = Some` -> iterate active shards, one
//! owner each). Gated by `config.community_detection_enabled` (default off); it is a background
//! job, so owners are processed sequentially rather than fanned out -- detection is infrequent
//! and interval-gated, and this keeps the loop simple and lock-friendly.
