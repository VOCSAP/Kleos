//! Event retention -- prunes expired events per channel's `retain_hours` setting.
//!
//! Each channel in `axon_channels` carries a `retain_hours` value (default 168,
//! which is 7 days). `prune_expired_events` iterates all channels and deletes
//! events older than that window. The entire operation runs inside a single
//! `db.write()` call so it holds exactly one write connection.
